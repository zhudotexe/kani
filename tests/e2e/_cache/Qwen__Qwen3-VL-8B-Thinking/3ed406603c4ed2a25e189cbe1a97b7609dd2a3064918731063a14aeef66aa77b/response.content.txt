Okay, the user just said "crab". I need to translate this into Japanese and return it in Romaji only.

First, I should recall the correct Japanese word for "crab". The most common term is カニ, which is pronounced "kani". Let me double-check to make sure. Yeah, "kani" is the standard Romaji for カニ. Sometimes people might use other terms, but for a general translation, "kani" is correct.

Wait, is there another way to say "crab" in Japanese? Maybe in a specific context, but the user just said "crab" as a general term. So "kani" is the right choice. Let me confirm by thinking of common phrases. For example, "I ate crab" would be "私はカニを食べた", so "kani" is correct.

No need to worry about nuances here since the user just wants the translation. The instructions say to return only Romaji, so I shouldn't include any Japanese characters. Just "kani".

Wait, the previous examples: "thank you" became "arigato", which is correct. "good morning" became "ohayo", which is the Romaji for おはよう. So yes, following the pattern, "crab" should be "kani".

I think that's it. No other possible Romaji for "crab" in Japanese. Let me check a dictionary quickly. Yes, カニ is kani. So the answer is kani.
