What's the current weather in Miami and what's the forecast for the next 3 days?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the current weather in Miami and the 3-day forecast. Let me check the tools available.

First, for the current weather, there's the get_weather function. It requires location and unit. The location is Miami, but I need to specify the state. Wait, the example given in the parameters is "San Francisco, CA", so I should include the state. So Miami, FL.

Then, the unit parameter can be fahrenheit or celsius. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should default to Fahrenheit, which is common in the US. So unit: "fahrenheit".

Next, the forecast for the next 3 days. The get_forecast function takes location as a parameter, and the description says it's a 3-day forecast. So I need to call that with Miami, FL.

Wait, the get_forecast function's description says "Get the 3-day forecast for a location." So the function is straightforward. The parameters only require location.

So I need two tool calls: one for get_weather with Miami, FL and fahrenheit, and another for get_forecast with Miami, FL.

Let me make sure the parameters are correct. For get_weather, required fields are location and unit. So I have to include both. For get_forecast, only location is needed.

Yes, that's correct. So I'll generate two tool calls.

<tool_call>
{"name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"location": "Miami, FL", "unit": "fahrenheit"}}
</tool_call>

<tool_call>
{"name": "get_forecast", "arguments": {"location": "Miami, FL"}}
