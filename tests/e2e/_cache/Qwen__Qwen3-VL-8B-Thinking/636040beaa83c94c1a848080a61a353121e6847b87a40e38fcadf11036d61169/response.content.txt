Okay, let me process the user's request. They asked for the weather in both San Francisco and New York, specifically in Fahrenheit. I called the get_weather function for each location with the correct unit.

First, I made two separate tool calls. The response came back with San Francisco having fog and 65Â°F, and New York sunny at 75Â°F. Now I need to present this information clearly.

I should structure the answer to list both cities with their respective conditions and temperatures. Since the user specified Fahrenheit, I don't need to convert units. Just need to make sure the response is concise and matches the query.

Check if there's any additional info needed, but the user only asked for current weather in those two cities. No mention of forecast, so stick to current conditions. Alright, put it all together in a friendly, clear format.
</think>

Here's the current weather report for the requested locations:

**San Francisco, CA**  
Foggy, 65Â°F  

**New York, NY**  
Sunny, 75Â°F  

Let me know if you'd like a 3-day forecast for either city! ðŸ˜Š<|im_end|>
