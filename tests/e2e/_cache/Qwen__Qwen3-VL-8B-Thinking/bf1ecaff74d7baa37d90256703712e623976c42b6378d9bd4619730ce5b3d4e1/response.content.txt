Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. The user asked: "What is (8 times 5) plus 10?"

First, I need to break down the question. It's two operations: multiplication and addition. The parentheses indicate that I should do the multiplication first, which is 8 times 5. Then add 10 to the result.

Looking at the tools provided, there's a multiply function and an add function. So the first step is to call multiply with a=8 and b=5. The tool response says 40, which makes sense because 8*5=40. 

Next, I need to add 10 to that result. So I should call the add function with a=40 and b=10. The tool response for that is 50. 

Wait, but the user provided two sets of tool calls. Let me check. The first tool call was multiply (8,5) returning 40, then add (40,10) returning 50. Then there are duplicates: another multiply and add. But the user might have just repeated the steps to test, but the answer should be 50.

I should confirm if there's any mistake here. Let's calculate manually: 8*5 is 40, plus 10 is 50. Yep, that's correct. So the final answer is 50.

The result of (8 times 5) plus 10 is **50**. 

Here's the breakdown:
1. **8 Ã— 5 = 40**  
2. **40 + 10 = 50**  

Final answer: **50**<|im_end|>
