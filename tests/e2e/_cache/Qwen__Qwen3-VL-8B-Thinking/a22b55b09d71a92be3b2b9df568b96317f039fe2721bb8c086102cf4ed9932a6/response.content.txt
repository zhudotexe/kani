Okay, let's see. The user wants me to calculate (2+3) * (4+5) * (6+7) using functions for each step. Let me break this down.

First, I need to handle each addition separately. So, the first part is 2+3. I'll call an add function with a=2 and b=3. The result should be 5.

Next, the second addition is 4+5. Using add again with a=4 and b=5, that gives 9.

Then the third one is 6+7. Adding those with add gives 13.

Now, multiply the results of these additions. First, multiply 5 and 9. So multiply(a=5, b=9) gives 45.

Then take that result and multiply by 13. So multiply(a=45, b=13) should be 585.

Let me check each step again to make sure. 2+3 is 5, correct. 4+5 is 9, right. 6+7 is 13. Then 5*9 is 45, and 45*13... let's compute 45*10=450 and 45*3=135, so 450+135=585. Yep, that's right. All the steps look good. So the final answer is 585.

The calculation steps are as follows:

1. **Add 2 + 3**  
   `add(2, 3) = 5`

2. **Add 4 + 5**  
   `add(4, 5) = 9`

3. **Add 6 + 7**  
   `add(6, 7) = 13`

4. **Multiply the results of the additions (5 × 9)**  
   `multiply(5, 9) = 45`

5. **Multiply the final result by 13 (45 × 13)**  
   `multiply(45, 13) = 585`

**Final Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{585}
