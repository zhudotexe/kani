Okay, the user asked "What time is it?" so I called the get_time function. But it failed with an error saying the time API is offline. Hmm, I need to let them know it's not working right now. Maybe the API is down, so I can't get the time. I should check if there's another function available. Wait, there's also working_function, but its description says it works correctly. Wait, but the user wants the time, and get_time is the one for that. Since get_time failed, maybe I should tell the user the API is down and suggest trying again later. The other function might not help here. Let me see, the error message says the time API is offline, so the correct response is to inform them it's unavailable and maybe mention the working_function isn't relevant for getting time. But the user might not need the time right now, so just apologize and explain the error.

The current time could not be retrieved as the time API is currently offline. Please try again later.
