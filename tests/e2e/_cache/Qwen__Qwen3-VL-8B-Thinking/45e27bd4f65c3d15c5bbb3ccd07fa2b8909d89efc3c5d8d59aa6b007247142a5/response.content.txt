Okay, let's see. The user asked for all users in San Francisco and their names and total order amounts.

First, I used the search_users function with city "San Francisco" and got back a user with ID 1 and name Alice. Then, I called get_order_total for user_id 1 and got 1225.

Now, I need to present this information. The user wants names and total order amounts. The response from search_users has the name, and the get_order_total gives the amount. So for Alice, the total is 1225. Since there's only one user, I should list her name and the total.

Wait, but I should check if there are more users. The initial response from search_users only returned one user. Maybe there are others, but the tool response only shows one. But the user said "all users", so maybe the tool response is incomplete. However, based on the provided data, there's only one user. So the answer is Alice with $1225.

I should format the answer clearly, listing the name and total. Let me make sure to mention the city, but the user already specified San Francisco, so maybe just the results.
</think>

User: Alice  
Total Order Amount: $1225  

*(Note: Only one user found in San Francisco.)*<|im_end|>
