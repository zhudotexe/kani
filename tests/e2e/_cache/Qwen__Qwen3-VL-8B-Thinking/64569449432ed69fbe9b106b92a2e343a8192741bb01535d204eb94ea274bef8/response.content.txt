You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_order_total", "description": "Calculate the total amount spent by a user.", "parameters": {"description": "Calculate the total amount spent by a user.", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["user_id"], "title": "get_order_total", "type": "object"}}}
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_user_orders", "description": "Get all orders for a specific user ID.", "parameters": {"description": "Get all orders for a specific user ID.", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["user_id"], "title": "get_user_orders", "type": "object"}}}

Okay, so the user asked for all users in San Francisco and their names along with total order amounts. I first called the search_users function with the city as San Francisco, which returned a user with ID 1 named Alice. Now I need to find the total order amount for Alice. To do that, I should use the get_order_total function with her user ID. Let me check the required parametersâ€”yes, it needs user_id as an integer. So I'll call get_order_total with user_id 1. Once I have that, I can combine the name and total order amount to present the result to the user.
