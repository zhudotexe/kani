# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "flaky_function", "description": "A function that fails the first time.", "parameters": {"description": "A function that fails the first time.", "properties": {"x": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["x"], "title": "flaky_function", "type": "object"}}}
</tools>

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Call the flaky_function with x=42. Retry if it fails, it should eventually work.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<tool_call>
{"name": "flaky_function", "arguments": {"x": 42}}
</tool_call><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
<tool_response>
First call always fails!
</tool_response><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user called flaky_function with x=42, and the response says the first call always fails. So the function is supposed to fail the first time. Now the user wants me to retry it because it should eventually work.

Wait, the problem states that the function fails the first time but should eventually work. So maybe there's a retry mechanism. But how does that work? The user is telling me to retry if it fails. Since the first call failed, I need to call it again. But according to the tool description, the function's first call fails, but subsequent calls might work. However, the tool's definition says it's a function that fails the first time. Wait, maybe the function is designed to fail the first time but then work on subsequent attempts.

But how can I know if it's the first call? The user is instructing to retry, so maybe in the context of the problem, the function is supposed to be called again. Let me check the initial instruction.

The user's message says: "Call the flaky_function with x=42. Retry if it fails, it should eventually work."

So the assistant called the function once, got a failure, and now needs to retry. Since the user specified to retry if it fails, the next step is to call the function again. But the tool response says "First call always fails!" so the first attempt is a failure, and the next one should work.

Wait, but the function is described as "A function that fails the first time." So maybe the function is designed to fail on the first invocation and then work on subsequent ones. So the assistant needs to retry after the first failure.

So the correct action here is to call the function again with the same argument, x=42. The tool response from the first call indicated failure, so the next step is to make another call.

Therefore, the next tool call should be the same function with x=42 again.
