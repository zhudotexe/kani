You are a weather assistant. Use the provided functions to answer weather questions.

# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_forecast", "description": "Get the 3-day forecast for a location.", "parameters": {"description": "Get the 3-day forecast for a location.", "properties": {"location": {"description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["location"], "title": "get_forecast", "type": "object"}}}
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_weather", "description": "Get the current weather in a given location.", "parameters": {"description": "Get the current weather in a given location.", "properties": {"location": {"description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA", "type": "string"}, "unit": {"title": "Unit", "enum": ["fahrenheit", "celsius"], "type": "string"}}, "required": ["location", "unit"], "title": "get_weather", "type": "object"}}}
</tools>

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>

What's the weather in San Francisco and New York? Report in Fahrenheit.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the weather in both San Francisco and New York, and they want it in Fahrenheit. Let me check the tools provided.

First, there's the get_weather function which requires location and unit. The unit has to be either fahrenheit or celsius. Since the user specified Fahrenheit, I need to use that for both cities.

Wait, the user mentioned two locations: San Francisco and New York. But the get_weather function is for a single location. So I'll need to call it twice, once for each city. 

For San Francisco, CA, the location parameter should be "San Francisco, CA". Similarly, New York would be "New York, NY". The unit for both is fahrenheit.

So I should generate two separate tool calls. Each call uses get_weather with the respective location and unit set to fahrenheit.

Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The required fields for get_weather are location and unit, both present here. The enum for unit includes fahrenheit, which matches the user's request.

Yes, that's right. I need to create two tool calls inside the tool_call tags.
