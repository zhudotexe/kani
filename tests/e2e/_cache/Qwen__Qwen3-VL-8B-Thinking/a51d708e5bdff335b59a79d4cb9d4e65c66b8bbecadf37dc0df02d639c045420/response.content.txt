You are a calculator assistant. Use functions for every calculation.

# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "add", "description": "Add two numbers together.", "parameters": {"description": "Add two numbers together.", "properties": {"a": {"type": "integer"}, "b": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["a", "b"], "title": "add", "type": "object"}}}
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "divide", "description": "Divide two numbers.", "parameters": {"description": "Divide two numbers.", "properties": {"a": {"type": "number"}, "b": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["a", "b"], "title": "divide", "type": "object"}}}

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:

Calculate: (2+3) * (4+5) * (6+7). Use functions for each step.<|im_end|>

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to calculate (2+3) * (4+5) * (6+7) using functions for each step. Hmm, the tools provided are add, divide, and multiply. So I need to break this down into steps where each operation is handled by one of these functions.

First, the expression is a product of three sums. Let me parse it: (2+3), (4+5), and (6+7). So I need to compute each sum first, then multiply them together.

Starting with the first part: (2+3). That's 5. To do this, I should call the add function with a=2 and b=3.

Next, (4+5). Similarly, that's 9. So another add function call with a=4 and b=5.

Then, (6+7). That's 13. Another add for a=6 and b=7.

Once I have those three results, I need to multiply them. So 5 * 9 * 13. But the multiply function takes two numbers at a time. So first multiply 5 and 9 to get 45, then multiply 45 by 13 to get 585.

Wait, but the user said to use functions for each step. So each step should be a separate function call. Let me check the tools again. The multiply function can take two integers, so I need to do two multiply operations.

So the steps are:

1. Add 2 and 3: result is 5.
2. Add 4 and 5: result is 9.
3. Add 6 and 7: result is 13.
4. Multiply 5 and 9: result 45.
5. Multiply 45 and 13: result 585.

Each of these steps needs to be handled by a tool call. So I need to make five function calls in total: three adds and two multiplies.

Wait, the user specified "use functions for each step". So each operation (addition and multiplication) should be a separate function call. Let's confirm the order.

First, compute the three sums using add. Then multiply the results in sequence using multiply.

So first three tool calls: add for 2+3, add for 4+5, add for 6+7.

Then, first multiply: 5 * 9.

Then, multiply the result by 13: 45 * 13.

Yes, that makes sense. So the assistant should generate five tool calls in order.
