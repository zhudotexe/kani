Okay, let's see. The user asked for the current weather in Miami and the 3-day forecast. I called both functions: get_weather and get_forecast for Miami, FL. The responses came back. The weather is humid, 85Â°F, and the forecast is partly cloudy, then sunny, then rainy.

I need to present this information clearly. Start with the current weather, mention the temperature and conditions. Then list the forecast for each day. Make sure to use the right units since the user didn't specify, but the get_weather used Fahrenheit, which is common in the US. Maybe mention if there's anything else they need. Keep it friendly and concise.

Here's the weather information for Miami, FL:

**Current Weather**:  
Humid, 85Â°F

**3-Day Forecast**:  
- **Day 1**: Partly cloudy
