# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_time", "description": "Get the current time in the user's time zone.", "parameters": {"description": "Get the current time in the user's time zone.", "properties": {}, "title": "get_time", "type": "object"}}}
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "working_function", "description": "A function that works correctly.", "parameters": {"description": "A function that works correctly.", "properties": {}, "title": "working_function", "type": "object"}}}
</tools>

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call><|im_end|>

Okay, the user is asking "What time is it?" So I need to figure out which function to use. Let me check the available tools.

Looking at the tools provided, there's a function called get_time which is supposed to get the current time in the user's time zone. The other function is working_function, but its description says it works correctly, but maybe it's a placeholder or not relevant here. Since the user is asking for the current time, the get_time function is the right choice.

The get_time function doesn't require any parameters, so I just need to call it. The working_function doesn't seem related to the question, so I should ignore that. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The user's question is straightforward about the time, so no other parameters are needed. Alright, I'll call get_time.
