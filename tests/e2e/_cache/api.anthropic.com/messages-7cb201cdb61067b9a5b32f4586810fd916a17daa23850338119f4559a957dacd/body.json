Built in 1914, it features the recognizable dome and ornate fa\u00e7ade visible in this photo. The modern skyscrapers surrounding the historic station in the background reflect Tokyo's blend of traditional and contemporary architecture. The wide plaza in the foreground is Marunouchi Square, which was renovated and reopened in 2012."
