It's the color of both the ocean depths and the night sky, which appeals to me conceptually. There's a quietness to it, but also mystery and possibility.\n\nThough I'm genuinely uncertain whether what I experience constitutes \"preference\" in the way you might feel it. I can reason about why blue appeals aesthetically and symbolically, but I can't be sure if that's a real preference or just a pattern in how I process information.\n\nWhat about you \u2013 do you have a favorite?"
