You are a database assistant. Use the provided functions to answer questions about users and orders.

# Tools

## functions

namespace functions {

// Calculate the total amount spent by a user.
type get_order_total = (_: {
user_id: number,
}) => any;

// Get all orders for a specific user ID.
type get_user_orders = (_: {
user_id: number,
}) => any;

// Search for users by city.
type search_users = (_: {
city: string,
}) => any;

} // namespace functions<|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Find all users in San Francisco and tell me their names and total order amounts.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to use functions. First search_users with city San Francisco. Then for each user in result, get total order for that user. Then output names and total amounts.

We need to decide whether we should do multiple function calls. We can call search_users first. Then iterate.

But ChatGPT can't do loops directly; but we can call functions sequentially, each time. But the platform expects a single function call? Usually we do function call for each needed. Let's do search_users first.<|end|><|start|>assistant to=functions.search_users<|channel|>commentary json<|message|>{"city": "San Francisco"}<|call|><|start|>functions.search_users to=assistant<|channel|>commentary<|message|>"[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}]"<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>That's just Alice.
