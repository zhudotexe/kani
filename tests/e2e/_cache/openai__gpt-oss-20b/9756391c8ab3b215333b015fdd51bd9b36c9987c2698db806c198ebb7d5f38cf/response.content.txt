We'll need to call get_weather for "Miami" with unit? Probably default? They didn't specify units. We'll choose units as "fahrenheit" maybe? Typically for location they want Fahrenheit. Provide both. Then get_forecast for Miami.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.get_weather <|constrain|>json<|message|>{"location":"Miami","unit":"fahrenheit"}<|call|>
