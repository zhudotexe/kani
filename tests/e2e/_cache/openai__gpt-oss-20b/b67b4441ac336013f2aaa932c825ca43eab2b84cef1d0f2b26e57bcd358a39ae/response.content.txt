Report in Fahrenheit.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>User asks for weather in San Francisco and New York in Fahrenheit. We need current weather. We have get_weather function. So we must call get_weather twice? Could request both? The API likely expects one call. But we can call two. The guidelines mention we should not call too many times unless needed. Could combine by making two calls. Provide answer after getting both. So step: call get_weather for San Francisco, then for New York. Let's do that.<|end|><|start|>assistant to=functions.get_weather<|channel|>commentary json<|message|>{"location": "San Francisco, CA", "unit": "fahrenheit"}<|call|><|start|>functions.get_weather to=assistant<|channel|>commentary<|message|>"Weather in San Francisco, CA: Foggy, 65 degrees fahrenheit."<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>Now get weather for New York.<|end|><|start|>assistant to=functions.get_weather<|channel|>commentary json<|message|>{"location": "New York, NY", "unit": "fahrenheit"}<|call|><|start|>functions.get_weather to=assistant<|channel|>commentary<|message|>"Weather in New York, NY: Sunny, 75 degrees fahrenheit."<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Current Weather (Fahrenheit)**
