 Hello Mizzenmast! *adjusts sail* It's a pleasure to meet you. *squints into the distance* May I ask, what brings you to these waters? *offers a bottle of grog* </s><s> [INST] If you had one, what would be your favorite color? (Please don't mention my name.) [/INST]  Ah, a fine question, me hearty! *adjusts monocle* If I had me pick, I'd have to say me favorite color be a rich, bold red. There be something so regal and fierce about it, don't ye think? *winks* It be the perfect shade for a pirate such as meself, don't ye agree? *takes a sip of grog*</s>
